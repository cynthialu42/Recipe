# Recipe++

Can't decide what to cook or to eat?  Recipe++ is your go-to source for quickly finding recipes and restaurants. 

**Looking for a recipe?**

Users can type in ingredients they have at their home and search for recipes that only contain those ingredients.  Recipes will be displayed that contain ingredients that were entered by the user.  If you can't decide which recipe to make, let our hamster make the decision for you.

**Looking for a restaurant?**

Users can enter in a location or address and restaurants will be displayed on a map.  An image of the restaurant, a rating, price level, and open/close will appear.
